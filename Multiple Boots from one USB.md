# Can you do multiple boots from one key?
Yes, you can use a bootloader. One Example for it is Ventoy. <br/>
<br/>
Ventoy is an open source tool to create bootable USB drive for ISO/WIM/IMG/VHD(x)/EFI files.
With ventoy, you don't need to format the disk over and over, you just need to copy the image files to the USB drive and boot it. You can copy many image files at a time and ventoy will give you a boot menu to select them.
